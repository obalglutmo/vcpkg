Adobe Type Manager (ATM) is a font management software that allows you to view, organize and print OpenType and PostScript fonts on your Windows computer. However, ATM is not compatible with Windows 7 64-bit, which means you cannot use it to install or manage fonts on this operating system. In this article, we will show you how to use ATM on Windows 7 64-bit by using a virtual machine.
 
## What is a virtual machine?
 
A virtual machine (VM) is a software that emulates a computer system, allowing you to run another operating system (such as Windows XP) inside your current one (such as Windows 7). This way, you can use applications that are not compatible with your current operating system, without affecting your main system.
