Some examples are ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, and CyberGhost.

This can help you verify the quality and authenticity of the file, as well as avoid any potential problems or issues. Look for positive feedback, high ratings, and verified uploaders who have a good reputation and history on the torrent site.
4. Scan the file with antivirus software. After downloading the torrent file, scan it with antivirus software before opening it or running it on your computer. This can help you detect and remove any viruses, malware, or other harmful software that may be hidden in the file. Some examples of antivirus software are Avast, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, and Malwarebytes.
