# How to Use Egm2008 Geoid Model in Leica Geo Office
 
Leica Geo Office (LGO) is a software package that allows you to manage, process and analyze geospatial data from Leica instruments. One of the features of LGO is the ability to use different geoid models to convert ellipsoidal heights to orthometric heights. A geoid model is a mathematical representation of the Earth's gravity field, which approximates the mean sea level.
 
One of the most accurate and widely used geoid models is Egm2008, which has a resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes and covers the entire globe. Egm2008 is available for free download from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) website. However, to use Egm2008 in LGO, you need to convert it to a format that LGO can recognize. This can be done using a tool called Geoid Gridder, which is also available for free download from the NGA website.

In this article, we will show you how to use Egm2008 geoid model in LGO in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and install Geoid Gridder
 
Geoid Gridder is a Windows-based application that allows you to convert Egm2008 geoid model files to Leica Geo Office format. You can download Geoid Gridder from [here](https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/geoid_gridder.html). After downloading, unzip the file and run the setup.exe file to install Geoid Gridder on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Download and extract Egm2008 geoid model files
 
Egm2008 geoid model files are available in two formats: binary and ASCII. You can download either format from [here](https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/egm08_wgs84.html). For this example, we will use the binary format, which has a smaller file size and faster processing time. After downloading, unzip the file and extract the .bin files to a folder on your computer.
 
## Step 3: Convert Egm2008 geoid model files to Leica Geo Office format
 
Open Geoid Gridder and click on File > Open Binary File. Browse to the folder where you extracted the Egm2008 .bin files and select one of them. For example, we will use egm08\_25.gsf.bin, which covers the area between 0Ã‚Â°N and 90Ã‚Â°N latitude and 0Ã‚Â°E and 360Ã‚Â°E longitude.
 
After opening the file, you will see a map showing the coverage area of the selected file. You can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel or the buttons on the toolbar. You can also change the color scheme or the contour interval using the options on the toolbar.
 
To convert the file to Leica Geo Office format, click on File > Save As Leica Geo Office File. A dialog box will appear where you can specify the output file name and location. You can also choose whether to save the file as a single grid or as multiple grids with different resolutions. For this example, we will save the file as a single grid with a resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes.
 
Click on Save and wait for the conversion process to finish. You will see a message saying "Conversion completed successfully" when it is done.
