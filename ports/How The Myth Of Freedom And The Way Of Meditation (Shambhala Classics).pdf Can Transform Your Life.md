# The Myth Of Freedom And The Way Of Meditation: A Book Review
 
What does it mean to be free? Is freedom something we can achieve by pursuing our goals and desires, or is it something that lies beyond them? How can meditation help us discover the true nature of freedom and liberate us from the chains of ignorance, habit, and emotion?
 
These are some of the questions that ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa, a renowned Tibetan Buddhist master and teacher, explores in his book *The Myth Of Freedom And The Way Of Meditation*. This book, first published in 1976 and reissued in 2002 by Shambhala Publications, is a classic of Buddhist literature that offers a profound and practical insight into the meaning and practice of freedom in the context of Tibetan Buddhism.

In this book, Trungpa challenges the conventional notion of freedom as the ability to achieve goals and satisfy desires. He argues that this kind of freedom is actually a myth, a delusion that arises from ignorance, habitual patterns, and negative emotions. He shows how our attitudes, preconceptions, and even our spiritual practices can become obstacles that bind us to repetitive patterns of frustration and despair.

Instead, he proposes a different kind of freedom, one that is based on wisdom, compassion, and awareness. He explains how meditation can help us cultivate these qualities and reveal the true nature of reality, which is beyond concepts and dualities. He also describes how meditation can transform our negative emotions into positive forces that can aid us in advancing toward true freedom.
 
Trungpa's unique ability to express the essence of Buddhist teachings in the language and imagery of contemporary American culture makes this book one of the best and most accessible sources of the Buddhist doctrine ever written. His style is clear, direct, and often humorous, but also profound and challenging. He does not shy away from addressing difficult topics such as death, suffering, devotion, tantra, and enlightenment.
 
This book is not only a theoretical exposition of Buddhist philosophy, but also a practical guide for applying it to everyday life. Trungpa offers instructions on how to practice sitting meditation, how to work with emotions, how to engage in meditation in action, how to cultivate an open and flexible attitude, how to develop devotion and trust in one's spiritual teacher, and how to practice tantra as a way of integrating body and mind.
 
The book also features a new foreword by Pema ChÃ¶drÃ¶n, a close student of Trungpa and a best-selling author of *When Things Fall Apart*. She shares her personal experience of reading this book for the first time and how it changed her life. She also offers some advice on how to approach this book as a reader and a practitioner.
 
*The Myth Of Freedom And The Way Of Meditation* is a book that can benefit anyone who is interested in exploring the meaning of freedom and how to attain it through meditation. It is a book that can inspire, challenge, and transform one's understanding of oneself and reality. It is a book that can open one's mind and heart to the possibility of true freedom.
