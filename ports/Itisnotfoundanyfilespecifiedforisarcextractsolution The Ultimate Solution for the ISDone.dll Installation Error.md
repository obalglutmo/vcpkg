1. Run the game's installer with admin rights
2. Run the game's installer in compatibility mode
3. Set the game's installer at high priority
4. Run system file and image scans
5. Reregister the ISDone.dll file

## 1. Run the Game's Installer With Admin Rights
 
One of the possible reasons for the error is that you don't have enough permissions to install the game on your system. To fix this, you can try running the game's installer with admin rights, which will give it full access to your system resources. Here's how to do it:

- Open the folder that contains the game's setup.exe file.
- Right-click on the setup.exe file and select "Run as administrator".
- Follow the instructions on the screen to install the game.

## 2. Run the Game's Installer in Compatibility Mode
 
Another possible reason for the error is that the game's installer is not compatible with your current version of Windows. This can happen especially if you are trying to install an older game that was designed for a previous version of Windows. To fix this, you can try running the game's installer in compatibility mode, which will make it run as if it was on a different version of Windows. Here's how to do it:

- Open the folder that contains the game's setup.exe file.
- Right-click on the setup.exe file and select "Properties".
- Select "Compatibility" along the top of the properties window.
- Select "Run this program in compatibility mode" and choose a compatible version of Windows from the drop-down menu. For example, if your game was released before Windows 10, you can try selecting Windows 7 or Vista.
- Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.
- Run the setup.exe file as normal and install the game.

## 3. Set the Game's Installer at High Priority
 
A third possible reason for the error is that your system is running low on resources and can't handle the extraction process of the game files. To fix this, you can try setting the game's installer at high priority, which will allocate more resources to its process and speed up the installation. Here's how to do it:

- Open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard.
- Select "Details" along the top of Task Manager.
- Find and right-click on setup.exe in the list of processes and select "Set priority".
- Select "High" from the submenu.
- Close Task Manager and continue with the installation.

## 4. Run System File and Image Scans
 
A fourth possible reason for the error is that your system files are corrupted or damaged, which can affect the functionality of ISDone.dll and other components. To fix this, you can try running system file and image scans, which will check and repair any issues with your system files and images. Here's how to do it:

- Open Command Prompt as an administrator by typing "cmd" in Windows Search and selecting "Run as administrator".
- Type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter to run a System File Checker scan, which will scan and repair any corrupted or missing system files.
