In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the features of Rider 2018.2.3 (x64) and how they can help you improve your .NET development experience.
 
## Smart Code Editor
 
One of the most important aspects of any IDE is the code editor. Rider 2018.2.3 (x64) provides a smart code editor that understands your code and helps you write it faster and better. It offers code completion, syntax highlighting, code analysis, refactorings, code formatting, and more.
 
Code completion helps you write code faster by suggesting relevant symbols, keywords, parameters, and snippets as you type. Syntax highlighting makes your code easier to read by coloring different elements such as keywords, variables, strings, comments, and more. Code analysis checks your code for errors, warnings, suggestions, and hints and shows them in the editor and in the solution explorer. Refactorings help you improve your code quality by applying changes such as renaming, extracting methods or variables, moving or deleting code, and more. Code formatting helps you maintain a consistent coding style by applying rules such as indentation, spacing, braces, and more.
 
## Powerful Debugger
 
Another essential feature of any IDE is the debugger. Rider 2018.2.3 (x64) provides a powerful debugger that lets you inspect variables, watch expressions, evaluate expressions, set breakpoints, step through code, and more.
 
Variables window shows you the values of local and global variables in the current scope. Watches window lets you add expressions that you want to monitor during debugging. Evaluate expression window lets you execute arbitrary code in the context of the current frame. Breakpoints window lets you manage the breakpoints that you have set in your code. You can enable or disable breakpoints, set conditions or actions for breakpoints, edit breakpoints properties, and more. Stepping commands let you control the execution flow of your program. You can step into or over methods, step out of methods, run to cursor, resume or pause execution, and more.
