Natural language understanding (NLU) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the ability of machines to process and comprehend natural language texts and speech. NLU is one of the most challenging and fascinating areas of research, as it involves not only syntactic and semantic analysis, but also pragmatic and discourse aspects of language use.

One of the most authoritative and comprehensive books on NLU is *Natural Language Understanding* by James Allen, a leading expert in the field. This book, first published in 1987 and revised in 1995, provides a synthesis of the major modern techniques and the most current research in NLU. It covers topics such as:
  
- Statistically-based methods using large corpora
- Speech recognition and spoken language understanding
- Grammars and parsing algorithms
- Feature structures and unification
- Logical forms and semantic interpretation
- Anaphora resolution and coreference
- Discourse structure and coherence
- Plan recognition and dialogue management
- Natural language generation

The book is written in a clear and accessible style, with numerous examples and exercises. It is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners who want to learn more about NLU. The book also includes an appendix on speech recognition and spoken language understanding, which is a rare feature among NLU textbooks.
  
If you are interested in NLU and want to get a copy of *Natural Language Understanding* by James Allen, you can download it as a PDF file from various online sources. However, be aware that some of these sources may not be reliable or legal, so always check the quality and authenticity of the file before downloading it. Alternatively, you can buy a hardcover or paperback edition of the book from reputable online retailers such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble.
  
*Natural Language Understanding* by James Allen is a classic work that has influenced generations of researchers and students in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of how machines can process natural language.

## Statistically-based methods using large corpora
  
Statistically-based methods are approaches that use large collections of natural language data, called corpora, to learn patterns and probabilities of language use. These methods can be used for various tasks in NLU, such as speech recognition, word sense disambiguation, machine translation, and information extraction. Statistically-based methods can be divided into two main types: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised methods require annotated corpora, where the data is labeled with the correct answers or categories. Unsupervised methods do not require annotated corpora, but instead rely on clustering or distributional analysis to discover the structure and meaning of the data.
  
Some of the advantages of statistically-based methods are that they can handle large amounts of data, cope with noise and ambiguity, and adapt to new domains and languages. Some of the challenges of statistically-based methods are that they require a lot of computational resources, may not capture the full complexity and variability of natural language, and may not account for contextual and pragmatic factors.
  
Some of the examples of statistically-based methods that are discussed in *Natural Language Understanding* by James Allen are:

- Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and n-gram models for speech recognition and part-of-speech tagging
- Decision trees and neural networks for syntactic parsing and semantic classification
- Bayesian networks and probabilistic context-free grammars for semantic interpretation
- Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and latent semantic analysis (LSA) for unsupervised learning
