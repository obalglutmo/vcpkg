NIST REFPROP 9 14 is a computer program that provides thermophysical properties of pure fluids and mixtures over a wide range of fluid conditions including liquid, gas, and supercritical phases. It is developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and distributed through the Standard Reference Data program of NIST[^1^].

NIST REFPROP 9 14 contains critically evaluated mathematical models, with the goal of representing the properties to within the uncertainty of the underlying experimental data used in their development. These properties (such as density, vapor pressure, viscosity, enthalpy, etc.) can be used to design solutions to challenges presented by a changing climate, as well as to provide accurate thermophysical data to users in the chemical industry, the petroleum industry, and academia[^2^].
 
NIST REFPROP 9 14 covers a variety of industrially important fluids and fluid mixtures, including accepted standards. For example, it currently contains standards vital to the natural gas industry (GERG-2008), fluids involved in carbon capture and sequestration processes, cryogens used in space applications, widely used industrial chemicals and solvents, air, water and steam, constituents of biofuels, and constituents of surrogates for complex fluids such as diesel and jet fuels[^2^].
 
NIST REFPROP 9 14 is supplied as an easy-to-use graphical-user-interface for Windows users, FORTRAN source code, and a DLL callable from a wide range of platforms and programming environments, such as Excel, LabVIEW, and MatLab. The user can select from a variety of units, flash calculations, properties, tables and plots. More detailed information about the program and how to obtain it can be found at https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop[^1^].
