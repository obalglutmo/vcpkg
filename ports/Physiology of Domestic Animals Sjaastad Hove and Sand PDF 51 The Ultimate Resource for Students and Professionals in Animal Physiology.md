The book consists of 21 chapters that cover topics such as cell biology, the senses, the endocrine system, the cardiovascular system, the digestive system, the reproductive system, lactation, bioenergetics and growth. The book emphasizes functional aspects of physiology and aims to develop the problem-solving skills of the students. The book also provides clinical examples that illustrate the physiological processes and their relevance to animal health and welfare. The book contains about 600 color illustrations, more than 3000 short statements that summarize key points, about 2000 questions that test the understanding of the concepts, and nearly 200 clinical examples that demonstrate the application of physiology to veterinary medicine and animal science.
 
The book is well-organized and user-friendly, with frequent cross-referencing that shows how different parts of the body work together as a functional unit. The book also has an introductory chapter that reviews some of the basic principles of physics, chemistry and biochemistry that are necessary for understanding physiology. The book has a comprehensive and easy-to-use index that helps the reader to find the information they need quickly. The book is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn more about animal physiology and its implications for animal production, health and welfare.
