If you want to use Sahi Pro for your testing needs, you need to get a license for it. There are two ways to get a Sahi Pro license: flat pricing or personalized quote.
 
## Flat Pricing
 
If you have a small testing team or a single machine to run your test automation scripts, you can opt for the flat pricing option. This option allows you to buy a user concurrent license for $995 per year, which lets you use Sahi Pro on any machine by any user, but only one at a time. You also get two runner licenses for free, which let you run your test scripts on any machine without using the Sahi Pro UI.
