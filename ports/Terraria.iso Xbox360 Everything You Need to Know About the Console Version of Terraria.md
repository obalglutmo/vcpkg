# How to Download and Play Terraria on Xbox 360
 
Terraria is a popular sandbox game that lets you explore, build, and fight in a randomly generated 2D world. Terraria was originally released for PC in 2011, but it was later ported to various consoles, including Xbox 360. If you want to play Terraria on your Xbox 360, you have two options: you can either buy the game from the Xbox Live Arcade store, or you can download an ISO file and play it on a modded console.
 
## Option 1: Buy Terraria from Xbox Live Arcade
 
This is the easiest and safest way to play Terraria on your Xbox 360. All you need is an internet connection and a valid Xbox Live account. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Go to the Xbox Live Arcade store on your console and search for Terraria.
2. Select the game and click on "Buy". The game costs $14.99 USD.
3. Follow the instructions to complete the purchase and download the game.
4. Once the download is finished, you can launch the game from your library.

Note that this option requires you to have the latest update for Terraria, which is version 1.09. This update includes many features and bug fixes from the PC version 1.2.4[^4^]. You can also play online with other players who have the same version of the game.
 
## Option 2: Download Terraria ISO file and play it on a modded console
 
This option is more complicated and risky, as it involves modifying your console and downloading files from unofficial sources. You will also need a USB flash drive or an external hard drive to transfer the files to your console. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure your console is modded with either JTAG or RGH. These are methods that allow you to run unsigned code on your console. If you don't know how to do this, you can find tutorials online or ask someone who has experience with modding consoles.
2. Find a reliable website that offers Terraria ISO file for Xbox 360. One example is Vimm's Lair[^1^], which has a verified ISO file that works on both JTAG and RGH consoles.
3. Download the ISO file to your computer. The file size is about 6.87 GB.
4. Extract the ISO file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder named "Terraria (USA, Canada) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)" that contains several files.
5. Copy the folder to your USB flash drive or external hard drive.
6. Plug your USB flash drive or external hard drive into your console.
7. Launch a file manager program on your console, such as XEXMenu or Freestyle Dash.
8. Navigate to the folder where you copied Terraria and select the file named "default.xex". This will launch the game.

Note that this option does not require you to have any updates for Terraria, as the ISO file contains the original version of the game that was released in 2013. This version is equivalent to PC version 1.1.2[^3^], which means it has fewer features and more bugs than the latest update. You will also not be able to play online with other players who have different versions of the game.
