# How to Download and Install WinUAE and Kickstart ROM 1.3
 
If you want to emulate an Amiga computer on your Windows PC, you will need two things: WinUAE and Kickstart ROM. WinUAE is an Amiga emulator that allows you to run Amiga software on your PC. Kickstart ROM is the firmware of the Amiga that contains the operating system and some basic libraries. Different Amiga models use different versions of the Kickstart ROM, and for this tutorial we will use version 1.3, which is compatible with most Amiga games and applications.
